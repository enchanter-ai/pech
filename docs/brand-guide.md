# Enchanted Plugins Brand Guide

## Identity

**Tagline:** Algorithm-driven tools for AI-assisted development.

**Three pillars:**
1. **Algorithm-named engines** — every feature backed by formal math
2. **Managed agent networks** — Opus orchestrates, Sonnet executes, Haiku validates
3. **Self-learning systems** — engines improve with every session

## Naming Rules

1. Every plugin is named after a game entity
2. The metaphor must be immediately obvious (Emu collects, Hydra hunts threats)
3. One game per plugin — no repeats except Minecraft (max 2)
4. The name must be short (1-2 syllables preferred), pronounceable, and memorable
5. The game must be well-known (>1M copies sold or cultural impact)

## Plugin Structure Standard

Every @enchanter-ai product is cloned from [`enchanter-ai/schematic`](https://github.com/enchanter-ai/schematic) — the canonical repo template. The tree below is the shape `schematic` ships. New siblings clone it, fill placeholders, and rename `plugins/example-subplugin/` before first commit.

Every @enchanter-ai product follows this exact structure:

```

## README Standard

Every product README must include:

1. **Header:** "An @enchanter-ai product — algorithm-driven, agent-managed, self-learning."
2. **Game reference:** explain the name's origin in the first paragraph
3. **Problem statement:** what pain point does this solve, with evidence
4. **Architecture diagram:** ASCII showing the plugin/agent/hook flow
5. **Named algorithms section:** key formulas in GitHub LaTeX (`$$...$$`)
6. **Install:** one-liner marketplace command
7. **Plugin table:** command, function, agent per plugin
8. **Comparison table:** vs competitors with honest feature comparison
9. **Lifecycle diagram:** where this product fits in the full ecosystem
10. **Contributing link**

## Algorithm Naming Convention

Every algorithm follows: `[Method] [Domain] [Action]`

Examples:
- Gauss Convergence Method (standard deviation minimization)
- Shannon Entropy Analysis (information-theoretic secret detection)
- Bayesian Trust Scoring (prior-posterior change risk assessment)
- Markov Drift Detection (hidden state transition recognition)

## Commit Message Standard

```
feat: <what was added>
fix: <what was fixed>
docs: <what was documented>
refactor: <what was restructured>
test: <what was tested>
```

One logical change per commit. Never batch unrelated changes.

## Agent Model Tiers

| Tier | Model | Role | When to use |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| Orchestrator | Opus | Judgment, design, intent | Main skill that interacts with user |
| Executor | Sonnet | Script execution, analysis | Background convergence, deep review |
| Validator | Haiku | Pass/fail checks, file validation | Quick verification, format checks |

## Report Standard

Every product generates dark-themed single-page PDF reports via the `docs/architecture/` pipeline:
- Background: `#0d1117` · Surface: `#161b22` · Border: `#1e3a5f` · Accent: `#58a6ff`
- Agent-tier accents: Opus `#bc8cff` · Sonnet `#58a6ff` · Haiku muted
- Generated via `docs/architecture/generate.py` + `docs/assets/puppeteer.config.json` (Chrome headless)
- Content: score bars, technique pills, audit findings, verdict with next steps
- Never hand-edit the diagrams or HTML — regenerate via `python docs/architecture/generate.py`
